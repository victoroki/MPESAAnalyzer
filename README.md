## 🛠️ Built With

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** - Mobile framework
- **[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)** - Navigation library
- **[react-native-get-sms-android](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-get-sms-android)** - SMS reading functionality
- **[@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage)** - Local data persistence

## 📱 Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- **READ_SMS** - To read M-Pesa transaction messages

The app only reads messages from M-Pesa (sender contains "MPESA") and does not access or store any other SMS messages.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- All transaction data is stored **locally** on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- Only M-Pesa messages are parsed and analyzed
- You have full control over your data

## 🧪 How It Works

### SMS Parsing

The app identifies M-Pesa transactions by parsing SMS messages with patterns like:

- **Sent Money**: `"XXX Confirmed. KshXX.XX sent to [Name] on..."`
- **Received Money**: `"XXX Confirmed. You have received KshXX.XX from [Name]..."`
- **Payments**: `"XXX Confirmed. KshXX.XX paid to [Merchant]..."`
- **Withdrawals**: `"XXX Confirmed. KshXX.XX withdrawn from..."`

### Categorization

Transactions are automatically categorized based on keywords:

- 🛒 **Shopping** - Shops, stores, supermarkets
- 🍔 **Food** - Restaurants, cafes
- 🚗 **Transport** - Fuel, petrol stations
- 💊 **Health** - Hospitals, clinics, pharmacies
- 💡 **Bills** - Utilities, rent
- 📚 **Education** - Schools, universities
- 💵 **Cash** - ATM withdrawals
- 💰 **Income** - Money received
- 📦 **Other** - Unclassified transactions
